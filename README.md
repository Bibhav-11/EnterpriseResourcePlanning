# Enterprise Resource Planning

The ERP System Console Application is a simple enterprise resource planning system for managing HR, Finance, and other modules using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C#.

## Features

- **HR Module:** Manage HR-related tasks, including employee records, payroll, and more.
- **Finance Module:** Handle financial transactions, invoices, and budget management.
- **Console Interface:** User-friendly console-based interface for interacting with the ERP system.

## Applying Object-Oriented Programming Principles

The ERP System Console Application applies several OOP principles, including:

- **Encapsulation:** The application uses classes to encapsulate data and behavior for HR, Finance, and other modules, making it easy to manage and maintain their respective functionalities.

- **Inheritance:** The `Module` base class is inherited by specific modules like HR and Finance, allowing code reuse and providing a common structure for all modules.

- **Polymorphism:** Each module can have its own implementation of the `Run` method, enabling dynamic behavior based on the specific module selected.

- **Abstraction:** The use of classes and methods abstracts the underlying complexity, making it easier to work with modules and their associated data.

By adhering to these principles, the ERP system achieves a modular and extensible architecture that promotes code organization and maintainability.
